# MysticBeats

MysticBeats is an innovative music management application that invites users to dive into a world of rhythm and melody. Developed over a span of 11 days, MysticBeats showcases my early strides in web development, featuring a curated collection of approximately 200 songs. As I continue to evolve as a developer, this project serves as a foundation upon which I can build more refined and feature-rich applications.
